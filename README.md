## About

It's a solution for a recruitment task to implement a page for a fictitious company that designs gardens. I received a Figma file with only the desktop design and a list of requirements for each section. 
I had to come up with the design for smaller screens on my own. I made this page fully responsive, and implemented a hamburger menu, an expanded menu, an expanded search field, a masonry gallery, a slider, and a pop-up gallery.
